      <h1>Massive Academy 1.0 Announcement</h1>

      <p>July 20, 2014</p>

      <p>Miss the beautiful homepage?  Times uh changin’ my good man (and woman) and so are we. We always want to be as transparent as possible with our now 6,000+ students and the many more of you that frequent our site.  So this homepage is still beautiful - in both honesty and transparency.</p>

      <p>When we launched back in January our mission was two-fold. To teach people new skills - skills that would make them powerful in the workforce today. And to not only teach them, but to teach them in the most effective way possible - keeping it fun, but also getting them to competency in the fastest way possible. And according to you we’ve done that quite well. So thank you for the kind feedback and that hasn’t changed I promise.</p>

      <p>At the same time we had a passion to go into schools and teach students these life-changing skills as well. We started One Million Lines to introduce coding lessons to students as well as help empower the schools to equip their students with the ability to code and succeed in today’s business landscape.</p>

      <p>In doing that we realized that to truly achieve a win in our eyes we would have to get these lessons infused into the curriculum. See it wasn’t enough for us to just show up, expose the kids to new concepts for a day and then just vanish like a cruel joke. 

      <p>No, we feel it is our obligation to not just expose, but to also equip students with the ability and confidence to succeed in a business environment that now depends on making and creating new, awesome things to succeed. And to go one step further to make it as seamless and easy as possible for the teachers to implement.</p>

      <p>That is what we’re passionate about. That is what gets us out of the bed in the morning, keeps us up in the wee hours of the night, and what buzzes throughout all of our conversations. Its our jam. Our mojo. Our passion.</p>

      <p>So that is where we’re going. We are focusing on schools and helping bridge the gap between what students should and are learning. And we’re doing it in the most effective and fun way we can imagine. Welcome to Massive Academy 1.0. </p>

      <p>Thank you for being a part of our young journey and here's to a bright future together,</p>

      <p>-Ryan Bonhardt <br> Founder & CEO Massive Academy</p>
