      <h2>Join Our 6,000+ Students Today</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="note">
          <p>Hi,</p>
          <p>I'm Ryan Bonhardt, the Founder of Massive Academy and the teacher for this course.</p>
          <p>The fact is that over 100,000 websites are being created every day. Websites are in higher demand than ever before.</p>
          <p>If you want to test a business idea quick... you need a website.</p>
          <p>If you want to start a blog and following online... you need a website.</p>
          <p>If you want to be a web freelancer and make $1,000s per project... you need to be able to build websites</p>
          <p>If you want to learn php, ruby on rails, python, or any other web development language...you guessed it, you need to know HTML and CSS and be able to build websites.</p>
          <p>You see the trend. And yet by 2020 there will be 1 million jobs in the US alone that will be unfilled because there aren’t you guys (and gals ;)) with the right skills to fill them.</p>
          <p>And I get it. There are so many resources out there and you don’t know which ones to choose. Some of them are just plain bad and some it seems like the instructors make it hard on purpose. Like it’s a secret piece of the pie they want all to themselves.</p>
          <p>I was there too. I tried teaching myself HTML and CSS multiple times just to quit and get frustrated. Then a couple months would pass and I’d get excited again. I’d startover, try to cram it all, get frustrated and quit again.  This repeated so many times I’m embarassed to admit it.</p>
          <p>But I’m not the only one. You may be in this exact situation right now.</p>
          <p>And it’s not all your fault.  The problem is that we’ve grown up trying to learn everything, like we’re cramming for a test before we start actually trying what we’ve learned. After all, we never want to fail a test right?</p>
          <p>Well we’re not going to do that in this course. In this course we’re going to start making websites from the very first day. And within a month you will have three beautiful websites you built yourself.</p>
          <p>We’re going to move fast, you’re going to stay excited, you're going to learn <strong>a lot</strong> and at the end you’re going to be blown away by how much you can do and know in such a short time.</p>
          <p>In less than one month from now you will know HTML and CSS and be able to build beautiful websites fast. If not then I will personally refund your money - every single penny. So come join me. Let’s learn start learning together.</p>
          <p>You're friend in learning,<br></p>

      <h2>What separates us from other courses?</h2>
        <h3>Speed</h3>
        <p>Learn fast - its not made from old outdated teaching methods where you learn everything up front and then start building. No that's boring, frustrating, overwhelming and just plain unecessary. In this course you're going to start building your first site from the beginning. The result: you'll stay engaged, excited and enjoy the interactive nature of this new type of learning.</p>
        <h3>Quality</h3>
        <p>Here’s the deal. There’s a difference between knowing how to build a site with HTML5 and CSS3 and knowing how to build one that really wows! Whether it's for looks, increasing sales, growing email lists, making your blog look professional or even making a personal page to start getting yourself online, you need to know how to make a site that functions how you want it and that separates you from the average person building average sites online. This course will do that. </p>
        <p>In less than one month from now you will know HTML and CSS and be able to build beautiful websites fast. If not then I will personally refund your money - every single penny. So come join me. Let’s learn start learning together.</p>
